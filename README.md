## License

  This theme is based on some sources. Unfortunately I couldn't recall any
  original authors. Publishing this theme on Github may help me to find them.
  Please let me know if you have any useful information. And please accept my
  advance appologies for missing information.

  Because I don't know exactly the original license (though it seems to be
  an GPL-2), I would provide this source under GPL-2. You can use this theme
  for your personal work, but you can't use it for any commercial purposes.
